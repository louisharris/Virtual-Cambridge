# Virtual Cambridge

## Requirements
 - Unity
 - GoogleVR Unity library

## Setup

Clone this project, and open in Unity.  
Once done make sure GoogleVR is added within unity.  
My project comes included with Asset store packages
 - Idle MoCap (found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/idle-mocap-28345) 
 - Modern Female Professional Secretary (found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/modern-female-professional-secretary-44429)  
 
 Once these are added, then images need to be added.  
 You can add your own images, but I would recommend to download my example images first and make sure it is all working.  
 You can download the images here, with the corresponding materials:

 Extract this into the Assets folder along with the other folders such that Resources and images are alongside Scripts etc.  
   
 You project should now be ready to run and test out!
