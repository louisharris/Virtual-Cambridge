# Virtual Cambridge

## Requirements
 - Unity
 - GoogleVR Unity library

## Setup

Make a fresh Unity project  
Clone this project, and add the assets into unity.  
Once done make sure GoogleVR is added within unity. -> See https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk   
  
**My project example comes requires these Asset store packages:**
 - Idle MoCap (found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/idle-mocap-28345) 
 - Modern Female Professional Secretary (found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/modern-female-professional-secretary-44429)  
 
 Once these are added, then images need to be added.  
 You can add your own images, but I would recommend to download my example images first and make sure it is all working.  
   
 **You can download the images here, with the corresponding materials:**  
 **https://mega.nz/#!I95BURxI!uBnROutFzuqXsfENUIQfa7zn0XBaezhcOH04I5gZxeA** 
   
 Extract this into the Assets folder along with the other folders such that Resources and images are alongside Scripts etc.  
   
 **Your project should now be ready to run and test out!**
